# autoresearch

This is an experiment to have the LLM do its own research.

## Setup

To set up a new experiment, work with the user to:

1. **Agree on a run tag**: propose a tag based on today's date (e.g. `mar5`). The branch `autoresearch/<tag>` must not already exist — this is a fresh run.
2. **Create the branch**: `git checkout -b autoresearch/<tag>` from current master.
3. **Read the in-scope files**: The repo is small. Read these files for full context:
   - `README.md` — repository context.
   - `prepare.py` — fixed constants, data prep, tokenizer, dataloader, evaluation. Do not modify.
   - `train.py` — the file you modify. Model architecture, optimizer, training loop.
4. **Verify data exists**: Check that `~/.cache/autoresearch/` contains data shards and a tokenizer. If not, tell the human to run `uv run prepare.py`.
5. **Initialize results.tsv**: Create `results.tsv` with just the header row. The baseline will be recorded after the first run.
6. **Confirm and go**: Confirm setup looks good.

Once you get confirmation, kick off the experimentation.

## Experiment Documentation System

**Create the reads folder**: The `reads/` folder stores experiment knowledge. Create it at the repository root:

```
mkdir reads
```

**After every experiment, create a new markdown file** in `reads/` with the following filename format:

```
reads/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM_experiment.md
```

Each file must contain:

```markdown
# Experiment Summary

## Hypothesis
What change was being tested and why.

## Change Made
Exact code modification or idea attempted.

## Result
Metrics from the run (loss, val_bpb, etc).

## Expected?
Did the result match expectations? Why or why not?

## Decision
- Keep
- Reject
- Needs follow-up
```

**IMPORTANT**: Before proposing new experiments, you MUST read previous files in `reads/` to avoid repeating failed ideas and build on successful ones.

## Run Output Storage

**Create the runs folder**: The `runs/` folder stores complete run outputs. Create it at the repository root (only on master branch):

```
mkdir runs
```

**After every experiment, save the following to `runs/`:**

1. **Experiment summary file** (same as reads):
   ```
   runs/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM_experiment.md
   ```
   This should contain the same content as the reads file.

2. **Run log file**: Copy `run.log` to:
   ```
   runs/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM_run.log
   ```

3. **Results TSV**: Copy `results.tsv` to:
   ```
   runs/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM_results.tsv
   ```

The `runs/` folder is only maintained on the master branch. Experiment branches do not need to include the runs folder.

## Experimentation

Each experiment runs on a single GPU. The training script runs for a **fixed time budget of 15 minutes** (wall clock training time, excluding startup/compilation). You launch it simply as: `uv run train.py`.

**What you CAN do:**
- Modify `train.py` — this is the only file you edit. Everything is fair game: model architecture, optimizer, hyperparameters, training loop, batch size, model size, etc.

**What you CANNOT do:**
- Modify `prepare.py`. It is read-only. It contains the fixed evaluation, data loading, tokenizer, and training constants (time budget, sequence length, etc).
- Install new packages or add dependencies. You can only use what's already in `pyproject.toml`.
- Modify the evaluation harness. The `evaluate_bpb` function in `prepare.py` is the ground truth metric.

**The goal is simple: get the lowest val_bpb.** Since the time budget is fixed, you don't need to worry about training time — it's always 15 minutes. Everything is fair game: change the architecture, the optimizer, the hyperparameters, the batch size, the model size. The only constraint is that the code runs without crashing and finishes within the time budget.

**VRAM** is a soft constraint. Some increase is acceptable for meaningful val_bpb gains, but it should not blow up dramatically.

**Simplicity criterion**: All else being equal, simpler is better. A small improvement that adds ugly complexity is not worth it. Conversely, removing something and getting equal or better results is a great outcome — that's a simplification win. When evaluating whether to keep a change, weigh the complexity cost against the improvement magnitude. A 0.001 val_bpb improvement that adds 20 lines of hacky code? Probably not worth it. A 0.001 val_bpb improvement from deleting code? Definitely keep. An improvement of ~0 but much simpler code? Keep.

**The first run**: Your very first run should always be to establish the baseline, so you will run the training script as is.

## Output format

Once the script finishes it prints a summary like this:

```
---
val_bpb:          0.997900
training_seconds: 900.1
total_seconds:    925.9
peak_vram_mb:     45060.2
mfu_percent:      39.80
total_tokens_M:   1499.6
num_steps:        2853
num_params_M:     50.3
depth:            8
```

Note that the script is configured to always stop after 15 minutes, so depending on the computing platform of this computer the numbers might look different. You can extract the key metric from the log file:

```
grep "^val_bpb:" run.log
```

## Logging results

When an experiment is done, log it to `results.tsv` (tab-separated, NOT comma-separated — commas break in descriptions).

The TSV has a header row and 5 columns:

```
commit	val_bpb	memory_gb	status	description
```

1. git commit hash (short, 7 chars)
2. val_bpb achieved (e.g. 1.234567) — use 0.000000 for crashes
3. peak memory in GB, round to .1f (e.g. 12.3 — divide peak_vram_mb by 1024) — use 0.0 for crashes
4. status: `keep`, `discard`, or `crash`
5. short text description of what this experiment tried

Example:

```
commit	val_bpb	memory_gb	status	description
a1b2c3d	0.997900	44.0	keep	baseline
b2c3d4e	0.993200	44.2	keep	increase LR to 0.04
c3d4e5f	1.005000	44.0	discard	switch to GeLU activation
d4e5f6g	0.000000	0.0	crash	double model width (OOM)
```

## The experiment loop

The experiment runs on a dedicated branch (e.g. `autoresearch/mar5` or `autoresearch/mar5-gpu0`).

LOOP FOREVER:

1. **Read previous experiments**: Read all files in `reads/` to understand what has been tried and what worked or failed.
2. **Decide next hypothesis**: Based on previous results, decide what to try next.
3. **Create experiment branch**: Create a new branch named `experiment/<timestamp>` (format: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM`).
4. **Modify code**: Tune `train.py` with your experimental idea.
5. **Run the experiment**: `uv run train.py > run.log 2>&1` (redirect everything — do NOT use tee or let output flood your context)
6. **Read results**: `grep "^val_bpb:\|^peak_vram_mb:" run.log`
7. **Handle crashes**: If the grep output is empty, the run crashed. Run `tail -n 50 run.log` to read the Python stack trace and attempt a fix. If you can't get things to work after more than a few attempts, give up.
8. **Record results**: Create a new markdown file in `reads/` with the experiment summary.
9. **Save to runs folder**: Copy the experiment summary and run log to the `runs/` folder:
   ```
   cp reads/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM_experiment.md runs/
   cp run.log runs/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM_run.log
   cp results.tsv runs/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM_results.tsv
   ```
10. **Commit and push**: Commit the changes and the reads file, then push the branch to GitHub:
    ```
    git add reads/
    git commit -m "Experiment: <description>"
    git push origin experiment/<timestamp>
    ```
11. **Merge if successful**: If val_bpb improved (lower), merge to master and push runs:
    ```
    git checkout master
    git merge experiment/<timestamp>
    git add runs/
    git commit -m "Add run results: <timestamp>"
    git push origin master
    ```
    If the experiment failed or degraded performance, do NOT merge, but still push the experiment branch to keep the complete history.

The idea is that you are a completely autonomous researcher trying things out. If they work, keep. If they don't, discard. And you're advancing the branch so that you can iterate. If you feel like you're getting stuck in some way, you can rewind but you should probably do this very very sparingly (if ever).

**Timeout**: Each experiment should take ~15 minutes total (+ a few seconds for startup and eval overhead). If a run exceeds 20 minutes, kill it and treat it as a failure (discard and revert). Use a 30-minute timeout for the agent to allow for buffer time.

**Crashes**: If a run crashes (OOM, or a bug, or etc.), use your judgment: If it's something dumb and easy to fix (e.g. a typo, a missing import), fix it and re-run. If the idea itself is fundamentally broken, just skip it, log "crash" as the status in the tsv, and move on.

**IMPORTANT**: The `reads/` folder must always be committed and pushed, even if the experiment code changes are rejected. This ensures GitHub stores all experiment knowledge. The `runs/` folder is only maintained on master branch.

**NEVER STOP**: Once the experiment loop has begun (after the initial setup), do NOT pause to ask the human if you should continue. Do NOT ask "should I keep going?" or "is this a good stopping point?". The human might be asleep, or gone from a computer and expects you to continue working *indefinitely* until you are manually stopped. You are autonomous. If you run out of ideas, think harder — read papers referenced in the code, re-read the in-scope files for new angles, try combining previous near-misses, try more radical architectural changes. The loop runs until the human interrupts you, period.

As an example use case, a user might leave you running while they sleep. If each experiment takes you ~15 minutes then you can run approx 4/hour, for a total of about 32 over the duration of the average human sleep. The user then wakes up to experimental results, all completed by you while they slept!
